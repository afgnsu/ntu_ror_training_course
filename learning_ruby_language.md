#Learning Ruby Language

It is true that you don't need to be a ruby expoert to do rails project. You are still required to know the basic knowledge of the ruby language, otherwise you are going to hit a lot of walls when you learn rails (When I learn rails for the first time I try to work on rails project without trying to learn ruby, BIG MISTAKE!) This course's main focus is Rails Framework, but we still need to learn the basics of Ruby language in order to learn rails effectively, don't just buy a Ruby book and start reading, that would cost too much time, my suggestion to get started on Ruby is the following:

##1. Codecademy's ruby course is a great place to start:

One of the best place to start learning a programming language, it will expose you to basics of ruby and object oriented ruby without going into too much detail:
